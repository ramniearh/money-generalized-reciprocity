###PRELIMINARY VERSION - TO VALIDATE AND REVIEW###

## Money as a mechanism of generalized reciprocity:
###### Charts for 1x2 (Coop&Def or DR & IR) strategy comparisons. Plotted for liquidity = 1, bc_ratio = 10
## Simulated data for #DESCRIBE EXTRA SCENARIOS,
##### ## # # # ## Describe: in Main manuscript? in SM?


# 1. Import libraries and packages, set file path -------------------------
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)

here() # Validation: this command should display the main folder containing the R project (not the subfolder containing this specific script)


# 2. Import and process C++ data  -----------------------
